.. _slamseq:

SLAMseq is a novel sequencing protocol that directly uncovers 4-thiouridine incorporation events in RNA by high-throughput sequencing. When combined with metabolic labeling protocols, SLAM-seq allows to study the intracellular RNA dynamics, from transcription, RNA processing to RNA stability.
